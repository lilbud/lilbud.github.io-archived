<h1>About</h1>
<h3>Hello! Welcome to my site!</h3>
<h3>My name is Brian, or lilbud (as many will know me).</h3>
<h3>This is the second (or third for some things) attempt at having a website dedicated to the various projects I've have done over the years. </h3>
<br>
<h4>My first attempt was a page on Google Sites, it worked but was a pain to keep updated as everything had to be done manually. This meant everytime I had a new project I had to manually create the page and manually add the images and text in one block at a time. Due to this, I eventually gave up on updating the site. The site is still live here: https://sites.google.com/view/buds-projects/home</h4>
<br>
<h4>One of the biggest parts of this website is the covers I've made for various concerts. After the Google Sites went down, I migrated those over to Flickr. Again, great site, but new things had to be uploaded manually and eventually I'd just forget to do so. Which meant when I'd get around to it, I'd have to dig through folders and check for new files, this also wasn't sustainable in the long run. I needed something that was easier to update to where I could just set it and forget it.</h4>
<br>
<h4>In comes Github, I've used it for various things over the years (and even for school stuff as of last semester. This is technically the 3rd attempt at a site on github (thats 5 different attempts for hosting my stuff, for those watching at home). My knowledge of HTML and CSS is basically non-existant, like I have a grasp on it, but nowhere near sufficent enough to write a whole website on my own (note: one that actually looks half decent). </h4>
<br>
<h4>Given this, I'd be limited to using a Github Sites template. Something that looked nice, was easy for someone like me to get running, and was easy to update. After much searching, I found the photorama theme. It looked good (check), easy to set up (check), and very easily updateable (check). </h4>
<br>
<h4>I can work on new projects, push to a few repos, and the site is updated just like that. No manual updating of files, no page editing for new images (this template comes with something called "Isotope" (https://github.com/metafizzy/isotope). Which automatically arranges images in order based on their folder. Which eliminates the major problem I had with Google Sites. The pages are updated and the images are put in the right place when I commit to the proper repo.</h4>
<br>
<h4>To explain the different parts of the site, gotta give a little history.
<br>
<h4>From 2015 to 2019, I was involved with the RetroPie project. Being part of the project gave me an opportunity to learn how to interact on a forum enviroment. During my time on the project, I made splashscreens (images that would show upon booting the raspberry pi computer). I also made themes for the projects frontend, EmulationStation. I made 6 themes total, as well as numerous splashscreens. There is a page dedicated to both of these.</h4> 
<br>
<h4>Another thing I did as part of the RetroPie project is I ran a <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/17174/game-of-the-month-links">Game Of The Month</a> feature from October 2017 to January 2019. By the time 2019 came around, participation kinda dwindled which kind of drained my interest in running the feature anymore. I choose to think mixing it up and eliminating the retroachievement challenge and no longer doing the art were factors.</h4>
<br>
<h4>Since at least 5th grade, I've been a big fan of Bruce Springsteen. After years of digging through the studio albums, the outtakes, and the official live stuff, I found out about the bootlegs. Tapes captured in secret through various means in order to document as many shows as the artist played. April 2018 I downloaded a copy of Passaic Night 1 1978, that was all I needed. I eventually stumbled across a community for this stuff, and once again I put my graphical knowhow to work. Noticing a lack of decent covers, I decided to start making my own. This later branched off into covers for several other artists.</h4>
<br>
<h4>And to finish off my personal history, Compilations. (This is a brief summary as I go into more detail in the info files supplied with the compilations I made)</h4>
<br>
<h4>Around the end of February 2020, I discovered a Springsteen compilation by EV2 titled "The Turnpike is Closed, Nobody Goes Home". A 4 disc compilation of a Springsteen concert that never happened, but was rather compiled from various live recordings to make one "ultimate" show. Originally I was just going to update "Turnpike" with different sources. But later decided to make my own. A month later, I released "Two Lanes, Two Hearts". A 4 disc compilation of my own design. The following month, I made "Nights at the Boston Music Hall", a 3 disc compilation from the 4 nights Bruce played the Boston Music Hall in March 1977. Later in the Fall I made "And the Leaves Came Tumbling Down", a compilation of 1980 and 1984. And a few months after that was "Nassau Nights", in the vein of the Boston Music Hall comp, the 3 nights at Nassau in 1980. </h4>
<br>
<h4>Between January and August 2021, I worked on a new compilation, "Somewhere Deep into the Heart of the Crowd". Having some issues with the previous ones I made, I wanted to make one mega compilation. One with every song I wanted to include but couldn't on earlier ones. This ended up ballooning to 8 discs spread across 6 volumes.</h4> 
<br>
<h4>That's it for my personal history, use the navigation bar at the top to visit the different pages. Thanks!</h4>
