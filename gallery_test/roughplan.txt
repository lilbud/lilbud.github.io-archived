to-do (possible):
rewrite to be lighter (currently around 300mb, most of which I don't use at all)
also make easier to maintain, as adding new pages is a nightmare

needs:
image gallery (simple, nothing flashy)
some sort of blog section with simple markdown files

image gallery:
    basic enough, uses lightbox2, and scales to window. 
    much easier to setup, file is only about 20 lines (and less than a KB) and it handles everything

make site as easy to update as possible
